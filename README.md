# randopassword

## Description

This motivation for this project was edit existing code to add a randomized password making feature
I wanted to allow the user to select from options of what type of text, numbers and symbols to use as well as how long of a password.
I built this project to allow a user to generate a randomized password as passwords can be difficult to create.
This solved the problem of a user having to create their own password.
Some things that I learned in this challenge was how to create an input field and how to pull information from it. I also learned to use promts and checkboxes. I also got practice in using click events.
I had difficulty actually getting the password to be created and will be asking in my next tutoring session for assistance.

## Installation

This website was built off a given code and I updated the html, css and javascript pages with my own code to add the prompt features and the randomization of the password.
